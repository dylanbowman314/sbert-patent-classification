A method for macro-encapsulating friable and non-friable asbestos fibers generated from asbestos cement pipe during a pipe bursting operation where a replacement pipe is also being installed, the method comprising the steps of: providing a flowable fill for forming an in-situ layer of a temporarily fluid macro-encapsulating material which absorbs and immobilizes asbestos fibers and pipe fragments, the macro-encapsulating material being applied simultaneously as the pipe bursting operation proceeds; providing a distribution head for receiving the macro-encapsulating material while simultaneously pulling the replacement pipe, the macro-encapsulation material being injected through a plurality of radially arranged injection ports formed in a circumferential pattern at a selected location on the distribution head into an annular region formed about the distribution head and replacement pipe, thus pressurizing the annular region, and wherein the distribution head includes a burst head for bursting the asbestos cement pipe, and wherein the injection ports are located forward of the burst head so as to pre-fill the asbestos cement pipe prior to pipe bursting, such that upon rupture and fragmentation, the pipe fragments are pre-wetted by the macro-encapsulating material; the macro-encapsulating material forming an in-situ layer around the replacement pipe being laid in the pipe bursting operation, whereby the macro-encapsulating material envelops the asbestos pipe fragments and fibers and co-mingles with exposed native soil and solidifies, achieving full circumferential encapsulation of the asbestos fibers and pipe fragments at the location of the injection ports, thus preventing the fibers and pipe fragments from later becoming air-borne; wherein the pipe bursting operation causes an action of shock and vibration, and wherein the action of shock and vibration of the pipe bursting operation forces liquefaction of exposed soil into the temporarily fluid macro-encapsulation material, thereby creating a continuous bonded mass of macro-encapsulation material, pipe fragments and asbestos fibers which are co-bonded with a thin layer of the exposed soil.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
